title: Ray Caster in C
---


This is a raycasting demo written in c using the SDL2 library for drawing
This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90â€™s game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting.
My goal for this project was to write better code, get more familiarized with the C programming language and understand the amount of work that goes into game production.
